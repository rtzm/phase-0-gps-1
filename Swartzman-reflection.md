# What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

Before this session, I was having some trouble keeping track in my head of how branches, local/remote, and pulls/pushes and merges all worked together. It feels like a fourth-dimensional approach to files and directories that I'm still figuring out how to internalize. 

# What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

I got a better sense of how the workflow goes when working in groups, how pull requests are sent and received when on different computers.

I got a better sense of why it's important to always be working in a feature branch from the whole merge conflict discussion.

Also, how to make good commit messages was a helpful topic that I think I'll use more frequently.

# What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

I wasn't sure about how to add images in Markdown notation, and the standard GitHub Markdown didn't have easy information about it.

# What still confuses you about Git?

I'm still working on how to not get so disoriented when moving between branches and between local and remote repos. I guess I get disoriented by this stuff since there isn't an easy way to map it all out in a spatial format, and I'm very much a spatial thinker.

# How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

It went well. I think my partner and the guide all had a good sense of when to jump in with suggestions and when to hang back while I drove. And when navigating, I was able to gather a bit more context for what all was going on.
