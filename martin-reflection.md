# What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

At the start of the session my biggest struggle has been keeping track of everything in bash. I came in somewhat familiar with GitHub, but not really familiar with using Git in the command line. 

# What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

I definitely got a clearer picture of some of the differences between Fetch, Merge and Pull commands, as well as a better overview of how Git and GitHub interact when there are more than one person working on a project.


# What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

I had to ask about the differences between a Fetch and Merge and a Pull. I also got come information on commit messages and how to do an image in a markdown file.

# What still confuses you about Git?

I think I'm getting a good overview of a Git. I'm still working on the relationships between Git and GitHub and when to push and pull as opposed to just doing a commit. 

# How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

I think it went very well. The Guide was there when we needed her, but also let us talk though problems. I think that my partner and I worked well in both the driver and navigator, and I'm glad the session allowed us to take both roles.
